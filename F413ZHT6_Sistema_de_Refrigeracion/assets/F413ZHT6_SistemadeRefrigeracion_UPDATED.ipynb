Often the number of ports needed exceed those available in the MCU. Digital I/O (input/output) capabilities can be expanded via the use of shift registers. To illustrate this issue, we address the problem of creating an alarm system under the assumption that multiple sensors are periodically read and multiple LEDs updated their state. \n","\n","\n","The software solution consists of two tasks: produce and consumer task. The producer periodically reads the binary string produced by the PISO shift register, stores its integer representation in the shared queue, and yields control. The consumer task can execute when data becomes available in the shared queue. On execution, it pops an integer from the queue, uses it to enable/disable LEDs selectively, and yields control. The shared queue is bounded without wraparound. The queue is protected via a binary semaphore. \n","\n","The project uses FreeRTOS CMSIS Ver. 2. The scheduling policy is Rate Monotonic (RM) with time triggering.  \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4b7e7185","metadata":{"id":"4b7e7185"},"source":["### <span style=\"color:blue\">Hardware requirements</span>\n","\n","\n","|Component|Quantity|Characteristics|Component|\n","|:---|:---|:-----|:---:|\n","|STM32 F767ZI|1| Development board|<img src=\"img_shift_register/stm32.jpeg\" alt=\"SIPO\" width=\"150\" eight=\"150\">|\n","|SN54HC595 |1|  8-bit Serial In Parallel Out (SIPO) shift register.
